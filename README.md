Based on the Isle of Mull, in the heart of the Hebrides, HWDT has been leading the way for the conservation of whales, dolphins and porpoises in the waters of western Scotland for over two decades.

We believe evidence is the foundation of effective conservation. Our research has critically advanced the understanding of species that visit seasonally or are resident in the Hebrides. Data are provided to the Scottish Government to inform protection measures for minke whales, Rissoâ€™s dolphins, harbour porpoises, and basking sharks across Hebridean seas.
